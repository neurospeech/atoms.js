# This project has been replaced with Web Atoms Core.
https://github.com/neurospeech/web-atoms-core - An Advanced MVVM Framework for JavaScript in Web and Xamarin.Forms

Web Atoms.js
========
Enterprise Grade JavaScript UI Framework inspired from Flex and Silverlight.

Web Atoms.js is the only JavaScript framework with precompiler [Atoms.js PreCompiler](https://github.com/neurospeech/atoms-pre-compiler).
AtomsPreCompiler compiles atoms markup into valid HTML5 by breaking up inline expressions into
generated JavaScript. This pre-compiled document runs in strict mode without using `eval` without compromising speed.

Web Atoms is inspired from Adobe Flex and Microsoft Silverlight and has very small learning curve. 
The project contains text template defined in Visual Studio C# Project which recreates output JS files and CSS files.

Build Instructions
------------------
Building Atoms.js project is very easy, you need Visual Studio 2012 onwards and you have to just transform all T4 text templates.

Model Interactive View Controller Pattern
-----------------------------------------
Web application usually contains dual MVC Frameworks, one on server side and another on client side. Maintaining two different MVC is difficult. MVC is good for server side where flow of data is simple as request-process-response. Client side UI frameworks need much more than that. Thats why with Atoms.js, Model and Controller remains on server side, Interactive View is at client side, and interactive view communicates with server with JavaScript Promises (One Liner AJAX).

Atoms.js is built using Component Object Modeling which expose properties for model, and commands for manipulating them. Components can be adujsted on document and data binding and command binding makes them absolutely free of JavaScript.

Each MVC JavaScript requires you to fully understand JavaScript, where else Atoms.js can be used by designers without knowing much of JavaScript. 

Documentation
-------------

<a href="http://web-atoms.neurospeech.com/docs/index.html" target="_blank">Hosted Documentation</a>

In order to view documentation with all samples, you can simply run the Visual Studio Project and test each sample along with the documentation.

For non Windows platform, you may have to use Apache or some similar web server to host this project as website and then open it on any browser. Since AJAX is disabled on all browsers while accessing it from file:// URI pattern, simply opening index.html on browser will not be sufficient. You can view all documentation without any problems, but to run samples with AtomPromise, you will need a web server.
